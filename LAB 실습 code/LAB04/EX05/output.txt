In this paper, we explore the 
feasibility of a medical train
ing system for breast tumor pa
lpation based on haptic augmen
ted reality (AR) technology. H
aptic AR is an emerging resear
ch area in haptics and virtual
 reality (VR), which is concer
ned with augmenting the haptic
 properties of a real object b
y means of virtual haptic feed
back. The AR-based tumor palpa
tion system consists of a real
 breast sample.
